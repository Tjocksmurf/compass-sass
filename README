Note:
    The compass gem and its dependencies must be built into a jar for jruby-1.*-complete.jar to be able to run compass.
    external_build/build_compass_gem_jar.sh will download the latest version of compass using `gem` provided in the jruby jar
    and write it to /lib.

To build:
    grails package-plugin
